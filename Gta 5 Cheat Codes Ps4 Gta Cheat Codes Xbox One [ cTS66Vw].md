<br>======================================
<br>
<br>GTA 5 gets re-released on pretty much every gaming platform that comes into existence, so we ll probably need those trusty GTA 5 cheats for many more years to come!
<br>
<br>To save you from trying to remember them all, our handy guide is here to help! Take a look below and you ll never need to memorise a GTA V cheat code again. 
<br>
<br>While most GTA games simply allow you to type in a cheat code while your character is walking around, GTA 5 has a few different ideas to mix up that formula.  Depending on which platform that you re playing on, these are your options for inputting cheat codes:
<br>
<br>On Xbox, PC or PlayStation, you can simply input the code on your controller at any time while you re wandering around the game world.  On PC, you also have the option of pressing one keyboard button (Â¬ in the UK or in the USA) and then typing in the cheat code on your keyboard.  On Xbox, PC or PlayStation, you can also enter cheat codes on the in-game phone! Press up on your D-pad to bring up the phone, then enter the special code!
<br>
<br>To activate GTA 5 cheats on PS5, PS4 or PS3 all you need is the correct button combination, or you can use the in-game cell phone (PS4 and PS5 versions only).  This page is a guide that will show you both methods, including all the tested and verified codes, and you ll be unlocking invincibility, vehicles, weapons and more in no time.  The cheats work with either Michael, Trevor or Franklin.  [SH9D]
